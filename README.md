# ESP8266 Midi Piezo Playback System 2022
This was a project I created back in 2022 when I decided to learn Arduinos for 2 months. It has a web interface which serializes a MIDI file to a customized binary protocol which is then efficiently stored in the SPIFFS storage of the ESP8266. The project took 1 month to create alongside a Windows CLI and Flutter-based NFC Android system which works on NDEF-formatted RFID tags.
